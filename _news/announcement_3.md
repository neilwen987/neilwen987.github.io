Our recent work [Contrastive Sparse Representation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776) has [generated considerable interest](https://x.com/yifeiwang77/status/1897023662328611062) as a promising alternative approach for efficient embedding retrieval, and we have been invited to publish the model on Hugging Face and Sentence-Transformer! Code available at [Link](https://github.com/neilwen987/CSR_Adaptive_Rep). 🤗🤗
