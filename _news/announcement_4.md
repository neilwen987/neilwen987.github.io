Our paper [Contrastive Sparse Representations (CSR)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776) was selected for an **<span style="color: #dc143c;">Oral Presentation (Top 1%)</span>** at ICML 2025! CSR compresses SOTA 4k-dim embeddings to just 32 active dimensions, achieving ~100× faster retrieval for RAG and vector databases with minimal accuracy loss.🏆🏆
