I am Tiansheng Wen, a Research Intern at [ByteDance-BandAI](https://bytedancebandai.notion.site/intro). My research focuses on enhancing the scalability and reliability of Large Language Models through structural and post-training sparsity. I am particularly interested in developing efficient methods, including sparse retrieval, sparse attention, and agentic RL, to empower LLM-based agents to tackle complex real-world tasks like coding and computer use without compromising general reasoning.

I am currently an final-year M.S. student at Xidian University, advised by [Prof. Bo Chen](https://web.xidian.edu.cn/bchen/en/index.html). I also spent a wonderful year at Stony Brook University, working with [Prof. Chenyu You](https://chenyuyou.me/). Additionally, I collaborate closely with [Prof. Stefanie Jegelka](https://people.csail.mit.edu/stefje/) and [Yifei Wang](https://yifeiwang77.com/) on developing efficient and scalable sparse methods.
